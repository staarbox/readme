# readme

this project is NOT made and organized by one person (i think so, kaidokaib doesn't know how to script)
this project is made by TWO persons.
the coder boy (TheGoodGamer) and KaidoKaiB (or salt)

though you might be thinking
"how can a boy name theirselves in github TheGoodGamer then rename to the coder boy?"
as i'm changing from TheGoodGamer to the coder boy, i like programming!
that's why i'm renaming to the coder boy.

for kaidokaib? uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
his readme is a lil bit cursed
